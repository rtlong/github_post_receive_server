GitHub has just received a <%= @payload['forced'] ? 'FORCED-' : '' %>push from <%= @payload['pusher']['name'] %> to <%= @repo %> on <%= @branch %> at <%= @payload['repository']['pushed_at'] %>.
 
<% if @payload['commits'].any? then %>
  The push contained these commits:
  <% for c in @payload['commits'] do %>
    ---
    
    Commit: <%= c['id'] %> 
    URL: <%= c['url'] %>
    Date: <%= c['timestamp'].to_time.strftime('%a %d %h %Y, %T %z') %>
    
        <%= c['message'].indent(8, false) %>
    
    <% %w(removed added modified).each do |k| %> <% next unless (files = c[k]).any? %>
      Files <%= k.titleize %>:
      
        <%= files.join("\n").indent(8, false) %>
    <% end %>
  
  <% end %>

  The push contained no new commits detected by GitHub; this probably means that it was forced by 
  the pusher and he had done a `rebase` or similar. You may have to take special steps to recover 
  from this, if you had pulled the overwritten commits. 
  See http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html#_recovering_from_upstream_rebase
  
  Also, If the pusher knows that someone has pulled his code and he is forcing pushes, yell at him!

You can compare the push on Github here: <%= @payload['compare'] %>
