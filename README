GitHub Post Commit Server
=========================

This is a template server for using with the github callbacks. Extend it, make
it your own, enjoy it. 

It's got the structure preferred by Passenger, as that's how I intend to use it.

For more details please see the following guide on GitHub:
http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks

And please, take a look at the source, that's what it's there for.
